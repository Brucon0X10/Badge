## Getting started with your BruCON 0X10 badge
When you power on your badge for the first time, you are greeted with a special boot animation. It's on the highest brightness at this point, so be ready..!

### 1) Using your badge

The BruCON 0X10 Badge has 6 buttons on the back side: the 4 directional ones you use with your left hand, and A/B with your right. 

* **A** is used for accepting/continuing,
* **B** for declining/exiting and to turn on/off the badge in launcher (single/double click)*
* **Up/Down** to select app in Launcher,
* **Left/Right** to change brightness in launcher.

You can power your badge via either USB C, or via the attached 18650 lithium-ion battery. 
The battery will charge when USB is connected. 

### 2) Apps Launcher 
The badge boots into a launcher application, from which you can run all the apps youâ€™ve installed with the up/down buttons. A starts the selected app. The following apps are present by default _(and cannot be removed)_:

* **BruCON Game**
* Nickname
* CTF Challenge 1
* CTF Challenge 2
* CTF Challenge 3

You can add you own apps and remove any (non-defaut) app that you install through the app store by pressing B in the launcher.

### 3) Connecting over USB
Connecting to your computer via USB allows you to tinker with your Badge internals, and lets you test Python code. Connect your badge to a computer using a USB C cable, and connect over serial, 115200 baud. You should see a menu appear with various options.

## :beer: Brucon Game :beer: 
Proof you can live up to our motto _Hacking For Beer_ and become a official BruCON Brewing Co. member!

We started you off by filling your copper still with some beer, now it is up to you to fill your tank. This can be done in two ways:

* You can **transfer beer between stills** by connecting them with a pipe (aka audio cable) and pouring the beer from one badge to another one (_literally hold the badge upside down_)!
* You can **hack your way into the factory** and create your own beer out of thin air!

Once you have completed in _Brewing_ a full tank of beer, come to one of the Brucon Brewmasters (_Crew member with the Brucon Brewing Co. Pin_), donate your beer and if you are one of the first to do so we will appoint you an official member!
